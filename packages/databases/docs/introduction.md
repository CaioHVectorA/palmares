# Palmares/Databases

## Introduction

This documentation will walk you through [palmares](https://github.com/palmaresHQ/palmares), but focusing on the [@palmares/databases](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@palmares/databases) package.

### A rough and quick intro to Palmares

Palmares databases is one of the packages from the [palmares](https://github.com/palmaresHQ/palmares) framework. The goal of [palmares](https://github.com/palmaresHQ/palmares) is to give you, the programmer, the freedom to use what you want while still maintaining a core, well defined structure. This way you can still use Drizzle or Sequelize as you already using. At the same time [library maintainers like Lucia](https://github.com/lucia-auth/lucia/discussions/1707), don't need to recreate adapters for every ORM available, palmares will be the common abstraction above all. This specially useful when thinking on a framework level. We can create abstractions like Auth, Admin, Scaffolding, without needing to worry about which ORM or server you choose to use.

## Description

**Palmares** is a framework that aims for unification and freedom. It's opinionated at the same time it's not. Bring your own tools, forget thinking if X works with Y. With Palmares it just works! You can use it even without a server!

It's aimed to work well on monorepos and have **ZERO** dependencies at it's core. You should be able to use it with most available runtimes.

## Motivation

The name of this framework is a tribute to Zumbi dos Palmares, a Brazilian hero who fought against the portuguese for the freedom of slaves in Brazil. A Quilombo was a place were the people who scaped slavery could go to live free in a community. This framework aims not to be yet another replacement tool or framework, but a framework that unify all JS ecosystem into one. It's about union and freedom of choosing what you want to use.

Every single day a hole bunch of time needs to be spent dealing with the complexity of making libraries work together. You just spent 3 full weeks trying to make your ORM work with your schema validator, guess what? Seems that a new ORM solution just came out yesterday.

With **Palmares** we can unify all the ecosystem into one by worrying in 2 fronts:

- How to make the framework easy to use
- How to make the framework easy to extend
